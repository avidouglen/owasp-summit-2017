## Why

This Working Session will look at Security Tests, a special type of test that confirms, via passing tests, that security issues either exist or have been fixed.

## What

 - When to write security tests
 - Common techniques
 - Transforming integration and e2e tests into security tests
 - Running tests against production
 - Instrumenting code to inject payloads
 - Running tests in parallel with builds or in-line
 - Inserting error handling into tests so that tests differentiate between an internal error and test failure
 
## Outcomes

This Working Session will produce guidelines for writing security tests.

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

 - Security professionals
 - Developers
