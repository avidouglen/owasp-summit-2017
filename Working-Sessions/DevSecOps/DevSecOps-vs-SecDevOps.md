This Working Session will be a light-hearted, round-table discussion on this very important topic in our community.

Should we talk about SecDevOps or DevSecOps?

## Why

As a community, we need to clarify these terms so that our message is consistent. 

## What

- Agree on what each term means, perhaps even considering OpsSecDev, OpsDevSec, and BizSecDevOps.
- Create clear definitions of these terms

## Outcome

The Working Session will deliver clear definitions of the terms DevSecOps, SecDevOps, OpsSecDev, OpsDevSec, and BizSecDevOps.

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- DevOps
- DevSecOps
- SecDevOps
- Security professionals
- Developers
